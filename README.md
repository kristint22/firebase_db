# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I decided that since I already knew MySQL and SQL that it was time to learn about and how to use a cloud database.I've always wanted to learn because the idea was always interesting to me, so might as well sit down and learn.

I decided to use Google Firebase to create my cloud database. Firebase has a lot of features and I knew that I would be able to learn how to create a server for my data, be able to use python to write the code to create and update the database.  

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database. Describe how to use your program.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Future Work

- Create subcollections that the different disciplines of science and then within those seperate based on gender and then create another subcollection to have the scientists of that gender of that science discipline 
- Create screenshots of common queries 
- Receive notifications of when there are changes that happened in the cloud database
- Restructure to have subcollections and have it be more of a hierarchal data structure
